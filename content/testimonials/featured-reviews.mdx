## Review Schema Data

For SEO purposes, here's how to implement structured data for reviews:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Your Business Name",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "reviewCount": "127",
    "bestRating": "5",
    "worstRating": "1"
  },
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Sarah Johnson"
      },
      "datePublished": "2024-01-15",
      "reviewBody": "Absolutely fantastic service! The team went above and beyond...",
      "reviewRating": {
        "@type": "Rating",
        "ratingValue": "5",
        "bestRating": "5"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices for Reviews

1. **Authenticity**: Always use real customer reviews, never fake ones
2. **Verification**: Implement a system to verify customers before they can leave reviews
3. **Response**: Respond to all reviews, both positive and negative
4. **Display**: Show a mix of ratings to build trust
5. **Schema Markup**: Implement proper schema.org markup for SEO benefits
6. **Legal Compliance**: Follow FTC guidelines for testimonials and endorsements
